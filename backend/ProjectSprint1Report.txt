Project Sprint 1 Report

This report breaks down the work distribution between John and Jorge for sprint 1 of the semester project. 
Sprint 1 focuses on developing a backend for an application to help plan and manage kids at daycare facilities.
 
John’s Work:

•	Started the project by setting up the initial parts of the database. 
        Decided what information the database needed to keep track of, and the details about the daycare center’s classrooms, teachers, facilities, and kids.
•	Wrote the first pieces of the Python program, which included creating the initial structure for the application and connecting it to the database.
•	Created the Login API which provides simple authentication for users. Identified and fixed errors with the SQL queries and APIs in the Python program.

Jorge’s Work:

•	Added CRUD operations to the Python program so it could add, change, and remove information about the daycare center’s classrooms, teachers, facilities, and kids.
•	Made sure the program could handle mistakes without crashing by adding error-handling functionality. 
        For example, if something went wrong, the program would still work properly and give useful messages about the issue.
•	Worked on the functions.py document that included logic for constraints and error-handling functions.

Working Together:

•	We both used Postman to troubleshoot all the APIs, to ensure that every part of the program functioned as expected. 
        This included verifying that the APIs correctly handled tasks such as adding new teachers or children and 	retrieving classroom information.
•	When we found parts of the program that didn’t work right, we fixed them together. 
        We made sure the database and the Python program had all the right information and worked well.
•	Both of us made multiple commits, pushing, and pulling our work to collaborate more effectively.
•	We made sure that all requirements in sprint 1 were covered, finalized, and worked properly. 
        We double-checked the database and the Python program to make sure all tests passed in Postman before finalizing the submission.
